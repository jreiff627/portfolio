        <h1>Reflections</h1>
        <p>As part of the EE/CPRE/SE program at Iowa State, each student is required to take a set of courses to help 
            them begin to build a portfolio. With this, there are several short essays we wrote to help describe 
            what we have learned here at Iowa State.</p>

            <h3>General Education Reflection</h3>
            <div class="reflection-text">
                <p>General Education classes allow a whole new way to see the world. A couple of my favorite classes I took at Iowa State University 
                    was Anthropology 2010: Introduction to Cultural Anthropology and Architecture 3210: History of the American City. Since I have
                     lived in the Midwest my entire life, it is easy to forget that there are other cultures with different values and beliefs. Both of 
                     these classes focus on how environment and culture mixes and evolves over time. A reminder that there are other ways to see the world
                      and other perspectives that may need to be taken into consideration when approaching a problem.</p>

                <p>In Anthropology 2010, I learned that there is no such thing as a “one-size-fits-all” solution when working with people. Cultural norms, 
                    economic structures, family systems, and belief systems all influence how a community interacts with technology. As engineers, it can 
                    be tempting to focus purely on efficiency, performance, or optimization. However, anthropology taught me to ask deeper questions: Who 
                    is this solution for? What assumptions am I making about the user? Could cultural values change how this design is received or implemented? 
                    This mindset pushes me to evaluate engineering solutions beyond their technical success and consider whether they are actually usable, respectful, 
                    and sustainable within a given community.</p>
                
                <p>Architecture 3210 expanded this perspective by showing how infrastructure decisions shape society for decades, sometimes centuries. Studying the 
                    history of American cities revealed how transportation systems, zoning laws, and urban planning choices created long-term economic and social 
                    consequences. Engineering decisions are never isolated; they influence access to jobs, education, healthcare, and public spaces. This class helped 
                    me understand that innovation is not just about creating something new, but about understanding how that creation fits into a larger system. When 
                    approaching an engineering problem, I now think more about long-term impact, scalability, and unintended consequences.</p>

                <p>General education classes also strengthened my ability to think critically and communicate effectively. In discussion-based courses, I had to defend 
                    my ideas, listen to opposing viewpoints, and adapt my thinking. That practice directly translates to professional engineering environments where 
                    collaboration is essential. Engineers rarely work alone; we work in multidisciplinary teams, and we often serve stakeholders with different priorities.
                     Being able to consider economic trade-offs, ethical implications, and societal impact is just as important as calculating the correct answer.</p>

                <p>Looking beyond the engineering solution means considering economic feasibility, global implications, and societal impact. For example, a technically 
                    advanced system may not be viable if it is too expensive for widespread adoption. Similarly, a product that works well in one country may fail in another 
                    due to infrastructure differences or cultural expectations. Urban development decisions can either promote equity or reinforce inequality. Technology 
                    can connect communities globally, but it can also widen gaps if accessibility is not considered. These broader dimensions influence whether an engineering 
                    innovation truly improves quality of life.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, my general education courses have helped me develop into a more thoughtful and well-rounded future engineer. They taught me that engineering is
                     not just about solving equations, but about solving problems for people. By understanding culture, history, and societal systems, I am better prepared
                      to design solutions that are not only technically sound, but also ethical, inclusive, and impactful in the real world.</p>

            <h3>Cumulative Reflection</h3>
            <div class="reflection-text">
                <p>Picture this: 6 am in Coover lab 2061, the sun is starting to rise, peeking over the top of Coover and reflecting all around the courtyard outside the windows.
                     I just finished my portion of the Embedded Systems 1 project, and although it works as a standalone file, when I try to merge it into the project, over 100 
                     errors fill the screen. This moment changed how I viewed teamwork and group projects. Everyone in the group fulfilled their task for the bot to work; however,
                      we poorly communicated variable names, and the overall project lacked the consistency that we could have created if we had worked together better. This experience
                       emphasized that engineering solutions must be designed with the entire system and team in mind, not just individual components.</p>

                <p>This lesson was reinforced throughout my time at ISU through repeated exposure to collaborative, team-based coursework. Many ISU classes challenge students to work 
                    in teams and groups, often randomized, which develop many professional skills. Working with different partners allowed me to avoid falling into a familiar routine 
                    with the same partner and instead challenged me to adapt to new working styles, roles, and perspectives. These experiences taught me to effectively contribute across 
                    various group settings and to approach engineering problems with greater awareness of integration, communication, and shared responsibility. Throughout all my courses, 
                    I quickly learned that paperwork was not just a headache, but rather an integral part of a successful project. Without the paperwork to outline the project requirements 
                    and divvy up tasks, it is easy to fly off track while working on a project.</p>

                <p>This statement directly translates into my professional experience during my internship. I had to analyze existing documentation to resume a project that had been left
                     unfinished. Because ISU coursework emphasizes thorough reading of lab manuals and project requirements, I identified a good starting point in the project. As my internship 
                     ended, I needed to put together my own set of documentation for the future engineer on the project. When a supervisor commented on the thoroughness of my report, I recognized 
                     that these skills were a direct result of the expectations and practices emphasized throughout my education at ISU. My internship experience further reinforced classroom 
                     learning by requiring me to navigate existing documentation and adapt to professional engineering workflows independently.</p>

                <p>My time at ISU taught me that engineering is more than writing functional code or completing individual tasks. Tools like empathy maps which appeared in multiple courses helped 
                    me design solutions that account for ethical human impact.  This document taught me engineering requires designing systems that account for integration, communication, and the 
                    people impacted by those decisions. Building a new device is so much bigger than just creating a successful product but rather considering how the product will impact others. </p>

                <p>Looking back, that early morning in Coover Lab marked more than a frustrating project moment; it sparked a shift in how I approach engineering problems. Through team-based coursework
                     and professional experiences, I have learned to take responsibility not only for technical outcomes, but also for the reliability, clarity, and implications of my work.  As engineering 
                     challenges continue to evolve, these experiences have reinforced the importance of adaptability, thorough documentation, and continuous learning, all of which will guide my professional
                      and ethical decision-making moving forward.</p>
